We would like to thank Dr. Raghu Ramanujan for his insight and guidance throughout the process.
% This section is optional. But if there are people you'd like to thank for their help with the project --- a person who contributed some insight, friends who volunteered to help out with data collection, etc. --- then this is the place to thank them. Keep it short!

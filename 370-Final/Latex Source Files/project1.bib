% A bib file is just a collection of entries that look like the one.
% shown below. This is a citation for our course textbook formatted in 
% the BibTeX format. The easiest way to obtain these BibTeX citations 
% is to Google the title of the paper you're looking for, along with 
% the word "bibtex". The top hits are usually pages like CiteSeer,
% CiteULike and Bibsonomy that will then give you the
% option of exporting the citation for that paper in the BibTeX format.
% Simply copy-paste the citation you find into this file. To
% cite a specific paper, just use its key inside the \cite{} command 
% in the appropriate place. I often modify the key that comes with the
% downloaded citation into something simpler that is easier to work with.

% NOTE: Simply placing a citation down here will not guarantee that it
% will appear in your references section! For that, you actually need to
% cite it somewhere in your text using the \cite{} or \citeauthor{}
% commands.
